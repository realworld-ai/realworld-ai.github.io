We are developing technology to acquire high-precision and stable location information even in indoor environments where GPS is unavailable, by combining various signal sources and sensors such as Wi-Fi, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), geomagnetism, and PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning). We aim to apply this to people flow analysis and navigation in hospitals, factories, and commercial facilities.
