"Bio-logging," which records behavior, physiological states, and environmental information by attaching small sensors (bio-loggers) to wild animals, is advancing. We are developing AI technology to highly accurately and effectively automatically recognize complex animal behaviors (predation, reproduction, social behavior, etc.) from multimodal data such as acceleration and video.
