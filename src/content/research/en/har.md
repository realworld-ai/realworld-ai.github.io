We conduct research on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to recognize everything from basic movements like "walking" and "running" to complex activities like "cooking" and "packing work" using sensor data obtained from smartphones, smartwatches, and dedicated wearable devices. We explore high accuracy using deep learning and learning methods to reduce labeling costs.
