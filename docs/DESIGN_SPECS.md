# Osaka University — Real-World Intelligence Infrastructure Lab — Design Specifications

## Project Overview
This document provides the design specifications for the visual identity system of the Osaka University Real-World Intelligence Infrastructure Lab website.

---

## (A) Logo Icon

### Design Concept
- **Core idea**: A central sphere represents "intelligence", three surrounding nodes represent the lab's infrastructure, and connecting lines signify interconnectivity.
- **Colors**: Blue gradient (primary) and white accents.
- **Style**: Modern, minimal, and easily recognizable.

### Specifications

#### SVG (Vector)
- **Files**: `/public/assets/logo.svg` (256×256), `/public/assets/logo-512.svg` (512×512)
- **Usage**: Site header, favicon, and digital media.
- **Properties**: Infinite scalability without quality loss.

#### PNG (Raster — generated by design vendor)
Please provide the following PNG exports with transparent backgrounds (PNG-32 with alpha):

| Size | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **512×512** | General use | Favicon, app icons, social profiles |
| **1024×1024** | High-DPI / backup | Retina displays, very large assets |

**Transparency note**: The logo background must be transparent; the mark itself should be fully opaque and sharply defined.

## (B) Logo + Lab Name (Lockup / Banner)

### Design Concept
- **Layout**: Icon on the left, English lab name on the right (three lines).
- **Colors**: Same blue tones as the logo; dark gradient background for contrast.
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial or equivalent), bold, large sizes.

### Specifications

#### SVG (Vector)
- **File**: `/public/assets/logo-banner.svg`
- **Size**: 3000×750 px (16:9 / 4:1 aspect is acceptable)
- **Usage**: Top headers, promotional materials, social media cover images.

#### PNG (Raster — generated by design vendor)
| Size | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **3000×750** | Primary banner | Site deployment, high-resolution displays |

**Banner text**:
```
Osaka University
Real-World Intelligence Infrastructure Lab
```

## (C) Homepage Hero Background

### Design Concept
- **Layout**: Dark gradient background with accent gradient circles (one near the top-right and one near the bottom-left) to add depth.
- **Safe areas**:
  - **Left text area** (x: 100–1300px; y: 300–1100px): for lockup and main heading.
  - **Right visual area** (x: 1400–2560px; y: 100–1340px): for illustrations or additional graphics.
- **Style**: Modern, professional, and technical.

### Specifications

#### Web-optimized assets
- **Usage**: Site homepage hero background; should be provided at the specified dimensions and optimized for web delivery.

**Important**: Do not bake any dark overlays into the image. Overlays (e.g., a semi-transparent black layer to improve text contrast) must be implemented in CSS so the display can be tuned for accessibility and A/B testing.
